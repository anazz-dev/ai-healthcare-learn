  <h1>Bias, Fairness, and Explainability in Clinical AI</h1>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Trust in clinical AI depends not only on accuracy but also on <strong>fairness</strong> and <strong>explainability</strong>.
    A model that systematically underperforms in certain patient groups—or produces opaque, “black-box” recommendations—risks harm, erodes trust, and undermines clinical accountability.
    This post examines how bias arises, how fairness can be assessed, and why explainability matters for clinicians and patients alike.
  </p>

  <h2>How Bias Arises in Clinical AI</h2>
  <p>
    Bias in AI is rarely intentional; it usually stems from the data used for training and the context in which models are deployed. Key sources include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Sampling bias:</strong> training datasets overrepresent one demographic (e.g. predominantly White patients in dermatology imaging).</li>
    <li><strong>Measurement bias:</strong> proxies for health status (like healthcare spending) may not reflect true need.</li>
    <li><strong>Deployment bias:</strong> models validated in tertiary centers may fail in community hospitals with different populations.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Case Example: Risk Stratification Model</h3>
  <p>
    A widely used U.S. hospital risk-stratification algorithm used healthcare cost as a proxy for illness severity.
    Because Black patients historically received less healthcare spending, the model systematically under-identified high-risk Black patients
    (<a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/366/6464/447" target="_blank">Obermeyer et al., Science 2019</a>).
  </p>

  <h2>Fairness Metrics in Clinical AI</h2>
  <p>
    Fairness is multidimensional and context-dependent. Common metrics include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Equal opportunity:</strong> similar sensitivity across subgroups.</li>
    <li><strong>Predictive parity:</strong> similar positive predictive value (PPV) across subgroups.</li>
    <li><strong>Calibration:</strong> predicted risks match observed outcomes equally well across groups.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    No single metric suffices—clinicians and regulators must decide which fairness criteria align with ethical and clinical goals.
  </p>

  <h2>Explainability: Opening the Black Box</h2>
  <p>
    Many AI models, especially deep learning, function as “black boxes,” making decisions that are difficult to interpret.
    Explainability tools aim to bridge this gap:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>SHAP and LIME:</strong> attribute predictions to input features (e.g. which lab values drove a sepsis alert).</li>
    <li><strong>Saliency maps:</strong> highlight image regions most influential in a radiology model’s decision.</li>
    <li><strong>Counterfactuals:</strong> show how small input changes would alter the prediction.</li>
  </ul>

  <blockquote>
    Explainability is not an end in itself—it is a means to <strong>clinical accountability</strong>.
    Clinicians must understand enough of an AI’s reasoning to responsibly accept or reject its recommendations.
  </blockquote>

  <h2>Ethical and Regulatory Perspectives</h2>
  <p>
    Both the <strong>FDA</strong> and the <strong>EU AI Act</strong> emphasize transparency, human oversight, and post-market monitoring of clinical AI systems.
    In practice, this means:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Vendors must disclose intended use, limitations, and performance data.</li>
    <li>Hospitals must monitor AI tools for bias and performance drift.</li>
    <li>Clinicians remain ultimately responsible for patient care decisions.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Conclusion & Next Step</h2>
  <p>
    Bias and opacity are not abstract risks—they directly affect patient safety and trust.
    Fairness metrics and explainability tools provide ways forward, but they must be combined with clinical judgment and regulatory oversight.
