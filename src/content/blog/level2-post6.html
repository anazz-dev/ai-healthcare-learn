  <h1>Evaluating and Validating AI Tools in Medicine</h1>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Not all AI tools that enter the clinic are created equal. Some are rigorously tested, others barely validated.
    For clinicians and hospital leaders, knowing how to critically appraise an AI tool is a professional responsibility.
    This post introduces the <strong>core principles of evaluation and validation</strong> for healthcare AI.
  </p>

  <h2>Internal vs External Validation</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Internal validation:</strong> The model is tested on a split of the same dataset it was trained on (e.g., train/test split). This checks performance consistency but may overestimate real-world reliability.</li>
    <li><strong>External validation:</strong> The model is tested on a completely independent dataset, ideally from another hospital or country. This provides stronger evidence of generalisability.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Prospective vs Retrospective Studies</h2>
  <p>
    Many AI papers rely on retrospective validationâ€”testing algorithms on stored data.
    While useful for proof-of-concept, true clinical robustness requires <strong>prospective validation</strong>, where the model is applied in real time during patient care.
  </p>

  <h2>Performance Metrics That Matter</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Sensitivity & specificity:</strong> Critical for diagnostics.</li>
    <li><strong>Area under ROC curve (AUC):</strong> Summarises overall discriminatory ability.</li>
    <li><strong>Calibration:</strong> Do predicted probabilities match real-world outcomes?</li>
    <li><strong>Decision curve analysis:</strong> Assesses whether using the model adds net clinical benefit.</li>
  </ul>

  <blockquote>
    A model with high accuracy in a dataset but poor calibration in practice may cause more harm than good.
  </blockquote>

  <h2>Usability and Workflow Fit</h2>
  <p>
    Validation is not only about numbers. A tool that disrupts workflow may fail even if its metrics are strong.
    Clinicians should ask:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Does the interface integrate with existing EHR systems?</li>
    <li>Is the output timely and interpretable?</li>
    <li>Does it add alert fatigue?</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Case Example: Sepsis Prediction Models</h2>
  <p>
    Several hospitals deployed sepsis early-warning algorithms.
    Some lacked prospective validation and overwhelmed staff with false alarms, leading to <em>alert fatigue</em>.
    In contrast, carefully validated systems with clinician oversight improved early detection and outcomes.
  </p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    Evaluating AI tools is about more than reading the abstract of a study.
    Clinicians should look for external validation, prospective testing, proper metrics, calibration, and usability.
    Only then can AI tools be trusted to support patient care safely.
