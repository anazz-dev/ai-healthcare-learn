  <h1>Decision Curve Analysis Tutorial: A PSA-Based Clinical Case</h1>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>In clinical research, prediction models are typically evaluated using discrimination (e.g., AUC) and calibration. However, these metrics do not reflect the real-world consequences of clinical decision-making. Decision Curve Analysis (DCA), introduced by Vickers and Elkin in 2006, fills this gap by measuring a model's clinical utility through the concept of net benefit across threshold probabilities.</p>

  <h2>Why Decision Curve Analysis?</h2>
  <p>DCA helps answer the question: "Does using this model improve patient outcomes compared to treating all or none?" It does so by calculating net benefit — a balance of true positives and false positives, weighted by the threshold probability at which a clinician would opt to intervene.</p>
  <p>Rather than relying solely on AUC or p-values, DCA evaluates whether using a model leads to better decisions <strong>compared to common strategies</strong> like “treat everyone” or “treat no one.”</p>

  <h2>Core Concepts Recap</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Threshold probability</strong>: The minimum predicted risk at which we would recommend intervention (e.g., biopsy). It reflects clinical preferences.</li>
    <li><strong>Net benefit</strong>: A summary of clinical value, expressed as true positives per 100 patients, adjusted for the harm of unnecessary interventions.</li>
    <li><strong>Baseline strategies</strong>: “Treat all” and “treat none” provide essential clinical comparators.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Teaching Case: PSA-Based Biopsy Decision</h2>
  <p>To illustrate DCA, we’ll use a simplified clinical case. Although modern practice includes MRI, we focus on <strong>PSA alone</strong> for teaching purposes.</p>

  <h2>Clinical Vignette</h2>
  <p><strong>Patient:</strong> Mr. J., 62 years old<br>
     <strong>Presentation:</strong> PSA = 5.2 ng/mL<br>
     <strong>No prior biopsy, no family history, asymptomatic</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Clinical Question:</strong> Should Mr. J. undergo a prostate biopsy based on his PSA level?</p>

  <h2>Diagnostic Strategies Compared</h2>
  <h3>Strategy A: Binary PSA Threshold</h3>
  <p>Biopsy if PSA ≥ 4 ng/mL. A yes/no rule — simple but crude.<br>
     <strong>Assumed performance:</strong> Sensitivity = 40%, Specificity = 90%</p>

  <h3>Strategy B: PSA-Based AI Risk Model</h3>
  <p>Uses PSA as a continuous input to output an individual probability of high-grade prostate cancer.<br>
     For example: “Patient has 12.3% risk of high-grade cancer → biopsy indicated (since >10%).”</p>

  <h2>Decision Curve Analysis</h2>
  <p>We analyze net benefit of each strategy across <strong>thresholds from 5% to 20%</strong> — reflecting realistic clinical preferences for biopsy.</p>
  <table border="1" cellpadding="6">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Threshold</th>
        <th>Biopsy All</th>
        <th>PSA ≥ 4</th>
        <th>AI Model</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr><td>5%</td><td>0.06</td><td>0.04</td><td>0.05</td></tr>
      <tr><td>10%</td><td>0.04</td><td>0.05</td><td><strong>0.08</strong></td></tr>
      <tr><td>15%</td><td>0.02</td><td>0.03</td><td><strong>0.06</strong></td></tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <h2>Interpretation</h2>
  <p>At <strong>10% threshold</strong>, the AI model has the highest net benefit. It leads to 8 more true positives per 100 men compared to no biopsy, and 3 more than using PSA ≥ 4. This illustrates that even a simple risk model based on PSA can improve decision-making compared to binary cutoffs.</p>

  <h2>Clinical Takeaway</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>DCA lets us compare models based on <strong>clinical consequences</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>Threshold = clinical judgment</strong>, not statistical output.</li>
    <li>Use DCA to <strong>quantify benefit</strong> and justify or reject predictive tools in practice.</li>
  </ul>
