  <h1>Continuous Monitoring and Auditing of Clinical AI</h1>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Deploying an AI model in healthcare is not the end of the journey—it is the beginning of its life cycle.
    Models evolve as data, populations, and workflows change.
    Continuous monitoring and auditing ensure AI remains safe, fair, and effective in real-world use.
  </p>

  <h2>Why Continuous Monitoring Matters</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Data drift:</strong> Shifts in patient demographics, disease prevalence, or clinical practice may degrade performance.</li>
    <li><strong>Model drift:</strong> Over time, accuracy may fall as the training distribution no longer matches the real-world setting.</li>
    <li><strong>Equity drift:</strong> Biases may emerge if some subgroups change faster than others in the population.</li>
    <li><strong>Operational safety:</strong> Unmonitored models can generate silent errors that compromise patient care.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Key Components of Monitoring</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Performance tracking:</strong> Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and calibration metrics updated regularly.</li>
    <li><strong>Fairness auditing:</strong> Subgroup analyses (age, sex, ethnicity, comorbidity) to detect inequities.</li>
    <li><strong>Usage monitoring:</strong> Logging how clinicians interact with the system—overrides, ignored alerts, adoption rates.</li>
    <li><strong>Alerting and thresholds:</strong> Predefined triggers for investigation when performance falls below safety margins.</li>
  </ol>

  <div class="callout">
    <strong>Best practice:</strong> Monitoring should be automated where possible, but include <em>human oversight committees</em> for accountability and context.
  </div>

  <h2>Auditing Practices</h2>
  <p>
    Audits are periodic, systematic reviews of how the AI system performs and how it is governed.
    Unlike day-to-day monitoring, audits check alignment with <strong>regulations, ethics, and institutional policies</strong>.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Technical audit:</strong> Evaluate reproducibility of results, dataset lineage, and version control.</li>
    <li><strong>Clinical audit:</strong> Review clinical impact, error cases, and clinician satisfaction.</li>
    <li><strong>Ethical/legal audit:</strong> Assess compliance with privacy laws, explainability, and fairness obligations.</li>
    <li><strong>Operational audit:</strong> Evaluate costs, workflow impact, and sustainability.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Governance Frameworks</h2>
  <p>
    Effective monitoring requires a governance structure:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Model owner:</strong> A named team or individual responsible for each deployed model.</li>
    <li><strong>Oversight committee:</strong> Multidisciplinary board reviewing monitoring dashboards and audit reports.</li>
    <li><strong>Incident response plan:</strong> Steps for pausing, rolling back, or retraining models if safety thresholds are breached.</li>
    <li><strong>Documentation:</strong> Version history, known limitations, and audit results accessible to stakeholders.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Case Example: Sepsis Prediction Model</h2>
  <p>
    A hospital deployed an AI sepsis prediction tool. Initial validation was strong, but after one year,
    monitoring revealed increased false alarms due to changes in lab testing frequency.
    The model was retrained and recalibrated, restoring performance and clinician trust.
  </p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    Clinical AI is not a “set-and-forget” technology. Continuous monitoring and regular audits are essential
    for maintaining safety, fairness, and trustworthiness.
    Institutions that treat monitoring as an ongoing duty—not an afterthought—will be best positioned to sustain reliable AI in practice.
