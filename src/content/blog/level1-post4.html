  <h1>Data Governance and Curation in Healthcare AI</h1>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Artificial intelligence is only as good as the data that fuels it. In healthcare, where decisions affect patient lives,
    <strong>data governance and curation</strong> are not optional—they are essential.
    Before clinicians and administrators adopt AI, they must understand how data is collected, stored, cleaned, and protected.
  </p>

  <h2>Why Data Quality Matters</h2>
  <p>
    Poor-quality data leads to poor-quality predictions. Common pitfalls include missing values, inconsistent labels, or unrepresentative samples.
    In medicine, this can translate into misdiagnosis, biased outcomes, or patient harm.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> Are diagnoses coded correctly?</li>
    <li><strong>Completeness:</strong> Are all relevant variables captured?</li>
    <li><strong>Representativeness:</strong> Does the dataset reflect the population it aims to serve?</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Principles of Healthcare Data Governance</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Privacy:</strong> Compliance with HIPAA (US) and GDPR (EU) to safeguard patient information.</li>
    <li><strong>Security:</strong> Encryption, access controls, and audit trails.</li>
    <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Clear documentation of how data is sourced and used.</li>
    <li><strong>Accountability:</strong> Designating responsible stakeholders for oversight.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Curation: Turning Raw Data into Usable AI Inputs</h2>
  <p>
    Data curation is the process of transforming messy, real-world medical data into structured, AI-ready datasets.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Standardising terminology (e.g., SNOMED CT, ICD-10 codes).</li>
    <li>Cleaning errors and handling missing values.</li>
    <li>De-identifying sensitive information for research use.</li>
    <li>Labeling datasets with clinician input for accuracy.</li>
  </ul>

  <blockquote>
    “High-quality, well-governed data is the oxygen for clinical AI. Without it, even the most advanced algorithms fail.”
  </blockquote>

  <h2>Case Example: Radiology AI</h2>
  <p>
    In radiology, curated datasets often contain thousands of annotated CT or MRI scans.
    Annotation by expert radiologists ensures the AI learns from reliable ground truth.
    Without careful governance—such as ensuring diverse patient representation—an algorithm might perform well in one hospital but fail in another.
  </p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    For clinicians, understanding AI begins with understanding data.
    Data governance and curation ensure not only compliance and safety but also fairness and effectiveness.
    Before deploying AI, hospitals must invest in robust governance frameworks and curation workflows.
